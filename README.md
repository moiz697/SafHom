SafHom 
SafHom is a face recognition security software written in Python that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to identify unknown individuals in real-time. The software is designed to work with CCTV footage and can be used in a variety of settings, such as homes, businesses, and public areas, to enhance security and safety.

The SafHom software works by analyzing the facial features of individuals captured in the CCTV footage and comparing them to a database of known individuals. If a match is found, the software will provide the name and other relevant information about the individual to the owner of the system. However, if an unknown person is detected, the software will continue to analyze their face for a period of one minute.

If the unknown individual stays in the area for one minute or longer, the SafHom software will alert the owner with an alarm, notifying them that an unknown person has been detected for an extended period of time. This feature is particularly useful in scenarios where there is a risk of unauthorized access or potential threats.

The use of AI technology in SafHom enables the software to continuously learn and improve its facial recognition capabilities, providing more accurate and reliable results over time. Additionally, the software can be customized to suit the specific needs of different users, such as by adjusting the sensitivity of the facial recognition algorithms.

Overall, SafHom is a powerful and versatile security software that can help enhance safety and security in various settings. Its use of AI-based facial recognition technology makes it a valuable tool for monitoring and detecting potential threats, while its real-time alerts ensure that users are always informed of any suspicious activity.
